# Part 3: Sentence Structure

## Word Order

The basic word order in Spanish is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), which is the same as in English.

* *Yo como una manzana.* (I eat an apple.)

However, Spanish has a more flexible word order than English. For example, you can place the subject after the verb:

* *Come una manzana Juan.* (Juan eats an apple.)

## Negation

To make a sentence negative, place the word **no** before the verb.

* *Yo **no** como una manzana.* (I do not eat an apple.)

## Questions

There are several ways to form questions in Spanish.

### Intonation

You can turn a statement into a question by raising the pitch of your voice at the end of the sentence. In writing, this is indicated by using an inverted question mark (¿) at the beginning of the sentence and a regular question mark (?) at the end.

* *¿Tú comes una manzana?* (Do you eat an apple?)

### Inversion

You can also form a question by inverting the subject and the verb.

* *¿Come Juan una manzana?* (Does Juan eat an apple?)

### Question Words

You can use question words to ask for specific information. Here are some common question words:

* **¿Qué?** (What?)
* **¿Quién?** (Who?)
* **¿Cuándo?** (When?)
* **¿Dónde?** (Where?)
* **¿Por qué?** (Why?)
* **¿Cómo?** (How?)

### Examples

* *¿**Qué** comes?* (What do you eat?)
* *¿**Quién** es ella?* (Who is she?)
* *¿**Cuándo** estudias?* (When do you study?)

## Clauses (Cláusulas)

A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb. Sentences can be formed by one or more clauses.

### 1. Independent Clauses (Cláusulas Independientes)
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a full sentence.
*   *Yo leo un libro.* (I read a book.)

### 2. Dependent Clauses (Cláusulas Dependientes)
A dependent (or subordinate) clause is **not** a complete thought. It adds extra information and must be connected to an independent clause. They are generally categorized by their function in the sentence.

#### A. Noun Clauses (Cláusulas Sustantivas)
These clauses function as a noun, often acting as the direct object of a verb like *saber*, *creer*, *decir*, or *querer*. They answer the question "what?".

*   Yo sé **[qué quieres hacer]**. (I know **[what you want to do]**.)
*   Ella cree **[que la idea es buena]**. (She believes **[that the idea is good]**.)
*   No me dijo **[si vendría a la fiesta]**. (He didn't tell me **[if he would come to the party]**.)

#### B. Adjective Clauses (Cláusulas Adjetivales)
These clauses function as an adjective, modifying a noun or pronoun in the main clause. They are often introduced by relative pronouns like `que`, `quien`, or `donde`.

*   La película **[que vimos anoche]** fue fantástica. (The movie **[that we saw last night]** was fantastic.)
    *   The clause describes "La película".
*   El amigo **[con quien hablé]** es de Argentina. (The friend **[with whom I spoke]** is from Argentina.)
    *   The clause describes "El amigo".

#### C. Adverbial Clauses (Cláusulas Adverbiales)
These clauses function as an adverb, modifying the main verb to tell *when*, *why*, *where*, or *under what condition* the action occurs.

*   **Time:** Llámame **[cuando llegues]**. (Call me **[when you arrive]**.)
*   **Reason:** No salgo **[porque llueve mucho]**. (I'm not going out **[because it's raining a lot]**.)
*   **Condition:** **[Si tienes dinero]**, puedes comprarlo. (**[If you have money]**, you can buy it.)
