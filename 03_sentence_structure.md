# Part 3: Sentence Structure

## Word Order

The basic word order in Spanish is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), which is the same as in English.

* *Yo como una manzana.* (I eat an apple.)

However, Spanish has a more flexible word order than English. For example, you can place the subject after the verb:

* *Come una manzana Juan.* (Juan eats an apple.)

## Negation

To make a sentence negative, place the word **no** before the verb.

* *Yo **no** como una manzana.* (I do not eat an apple.)

## Questions

There are several ways to form questions in Spanish.

### Intonation

You can turn a statement into a question by raising the pitch of your voice at the end of the sentence. In writing, this is indicated by using an inverted question mark (¿) at the beginning of the sentence and a regular question mark (?) at the end.

* *¿Tú comes una manzana?* (Do you eat an apple?)

### Inversion

You can also form a question by inverting the subject and the verb.

* *¿Come Juan una manzana?* (Does Juan eat an apple?)

### Question Words

You can use question words to ask for specific information. Here are some common question words:

* **¿Qué?** (What?)
* **¿Quién?** (Who?)
* **¿Cuándo?** (When?)
* **¿Dónde?** (Where?)
* **¿Por qué?** (Why?)
* **¿Cómo?** (How?)

### Examples

* *¿**Qué** comes?* (What do you eat?)
* *¿**Quién** es ella?* (Who is she?)
* *¿**Cuándo** estudias?* (When do you study?)
