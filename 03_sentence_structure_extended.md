# Part 3: Sentence Structure (Extended)

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. In Spanish, there are direct object pronouns and indirect object pronouns.

### Direct Object Pronouns

Direct object pronouns replace the noun that directly receives the action of the verb. They are:

*   **me** (me)
*   **te** (you)
*   **lo, la** (him, her, it, you formal)
*   **nos** (us)
*   **os** (you all)
*   **los, las** (them, you all formal)

### Indirect Object Pronouns

Indirect object pronouns indicate to whom or for whom an action is done. They are:

*   **me** (to/for me)
*   **te** (to/for you)
*   **le** (to/for him, her, you formal)
*   **nos** (to/for us)
*   **os** (to/for you all)
*   **les** (to/for them, you all formal)

### Pronoun Placement

In general, object pronouns are placed **before** a conjugated verb.

*   *Veo el libro.* -> ***Lo** veo.* (I see the book. -> I see it.)
*   *Le doy el libro a Juan.* -> ***Le** doy el libro.* (I give the book to Juan. -> I give the book to him.)

However, there are a few exceptions:

#### Infinitives and Gerunds

With infinitives (-ar, -er, -ir) and gerunds (-ando, -iendo), the pronouns can be attached to the end of the verb.

*   **Infinitive:** *Voy a comprar el libro.* -> *Voy a comprar**lo**.* OR ***Lo** voy a comprar.* (I am going to buy the book. -> I am going to buy it.)
*   **Gerund:** *Estoy comiendo la manzana.* -> *Estoy comiéndo**la**.* OR ***La** estoy comiendo.* (I am eating the apple. -> I am eating it.)

When you attach a pronoun to a gerund, you often need to add an accent to the stressed vowel.

#### Affirmative Commands

With affirmative commands, the pronouns are always attached to the end of the verb.

*   *Compra el libro.* -> *Cómpralo.* (Buy the book. -> Buy it.)
*   *Dime la verdad.* (Tell me the truth.)

### Double Object Pronouns

When you have both a direct and an indirect object pronoun in the same sentence, the indirect object pronoun comes first.

*   *Te doy el libro.* -> ***Te lo** doy.* (I give you the book. -> I give it to you.)

#### The "se" Transformation

If both pronouns begin with the letter "l" (i.e., le/les and lo/la/los/las), the indirect object pronoun changes to **se**.

*   *Le doy el libro a ella.* -> ***Se lo** doy.* (I give the book to her. -> I give it to her.)
*   *Les compro las flores a mis amigas.* -> ***Se las** compro.* (I buy the flowers for my friends. -> I buy them for them.)

This change is made to avoid the awkward sound of "le lo," "le la," etc.
