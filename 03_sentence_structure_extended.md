# Part 3: Sentence Structure (Extended)

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. This section provides a comprehensive look at object pronouns and prepositional pronouns.

### Object Pronouns (Direct and Indirect)

Object pronouns replace the noun that receives the action of the verb.

* **Direct Object Pronouns**: *me, te, lo, la, nos, os, los, las*
* **Indirect Object Pronouns**: *me, te, le, nos, os, les*

#### Rule 1: Agreement

This is the most important rule: Object pronouns agree in gender and number with the **noun they replace (the object)**, not the subject of the sentence.

* **Direct Objects** agree in **gender and number**.
  * *Yo compro **la falda**.* (feminine, singular) -> *Yo **la** compro.*
  * *María ve **los barcos**.* (masculine, plural) -> *María **los** ve.*

* **Indirect Objects** agree in **number only**. They do not have a gender.
  * *Hablo **a mi amigo**.* (singular) -> ***Le** hablo.*
  * *Hablo **a mi amiga**.* (singular) -> ***Le** hablo.*
  * *Hablo **a mis amigos**.* (plural) -> ***Les** hablo.*

#### Rule 2: Placement

The placement of object pronouns depends on the form of the verb.

| Verb Form | Pronoun Position | Example(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conjugated Verb** | Before the verb | ***Lo** veo.* (I see it.)<br>***Te** lo doy.* (I give it to you.) |
| **Infinitive (-ar/-er/-ir)** | Attached to infinitive OR before conjugated verb | *Voy a comprar**lo**.*<br>***Lo** voy a comprar.* |
| **Gerund (-ando/-iendo)** | Attached to gerund OR before conjugated verb | *Estoy comiéndo**la**.*<br>***La** estoy comiendo.* |
| **Affirmative Command** | Attached to command | *¡Cómpralo!* (Buy it!)<br>*¡Dímelo!* (Tell it to me!) |
| **Negative Command** | Before the verb | *¡No **lo** compres!* (Don't buy it!)<br>*¡No **me lo** digas!* (Don't tell it to me!) |

#### Rule 3: Order of Multiple Pronouns

When you have both a direct and an indirect pronoun, the **indirect pronoun always comes first**. A helpful mnemonic is **RID**: **R**eflexive -> **I**ndirect -> **D**irect.

* *Te doy el libro.* -> ***Te lo** doy.* (I give it to you.)

If both pronouns start with "l" (*le/les* + *lo/la/los/las*), the indirect pronoun **changes to `se`**.

* *Le doy el libro a ella.* -> ***Se lo** doy.* (I give the book to her.)
* *Les compro las flores a ellos.* -> ***Se las** compro.* (I buy them for them.)

### Prepositional Pronouns

These pronouns are used after prepositions (like *a, de, con, en, para, por, sin*).

| Subject | Prepositional Pronoun |
| :--- | :--- |
| yo | **mí** |
| tú | **ti** |
| él | **él** |
| ella | **ella** |
| usted | **usted** |
| nosotros/as | **nosotros/as** |
| vosotros/as | **vosotros/as** |
| ellos/ellas | **ellos/ellas** |
| ustedes | **ustedes** |

* *Esta carta es para **mí**.* (This letter is for **me**.)
* *Hablan de **ella**.* (They are talking about **her**.)
* *Voy a la fiesta con **ellos**.* (I am going to the party with **them**.)

#### Special Cases: `conmigo` and `contigo`

The forms for "with me" and "with you" (informal) are irregular single words.

* **con + mí** -> ***conmigo*** (with me)
* **con + ti** -> ***contigo*** (with you)

* *¿Vienes **conmigo**?* (Are you coming **with me**?)
* *Quiero hablar **contigo**.* (I want to talk **with you**.)

## Placement of Adjectives

While in English adjectives usually come before the noun, in Spanish the most common position is **after** the noun.

* *el coche **rojo*** (the **red** car)
* *una casa **grande*** (a **big** house)

### Adjectives Before the Noun

Some adjectives can be placed before the noun. This is often done for emphasis or to convey a more subjective, poetic quality. Some adjectives change their meaning depending on their position.

* **Adjective with different meanings:**
  * *un amigo **viejo*** (an **old** friend, in age)
  * *un **viejo** amigo* (a **long-time** friend)
  * *una mujer **pobre*** (a **poor** woman, no money)
  * *una **pobre** mujer* (a **pitiful/unfortunate** woman)

* **Adjectives for emphasis:** Adjectives like *bueno*, *malo*, *grande*, and *nuevo* often appear before the noun.
  * *un **buen** día* (a **good** day)
  * *un **gran** problema* (a **big** problem) - *note that `grande` shortens to `gran` before a singular noun.*

## Placement of Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Their placement depends on what they are modifying.

* **Modifying a verb:** The adverb usually goes **after** the verb.
  * *Ella habla **lentamente**.* (She speaks **slowly**.)
  * *Comimos **mucho**.* (We ate **a lot**.)

* **Modifying an adjective or another adverb:** The adverb goes **before** the word it modifies.
  * *La casa es **muy** grande.* (The house is **very** big.)
  * *Hablas **demasiado** rápido.* (You speak **too** quickly.)

* **Adverbs of time/place:** These are very flexible and can often be placed at the beginning or end of a sentence for emphasis.
  * ***Mañana** iré al mercado.* (Tomorrow I will go to the market.)
  * *Iré al mercado **mañana**.* (I will go to the market tomorrow.)

## More Word Order Variations

As noted in the basic guide, Spanish word order is flexible. This is often used for emphasis.

### Emphasizing the Object

You can move the direct or indirect object to the beginning of the sentence for emphasis. When you do this, you must also include the corresponding object pronoun.

* **Standard:** *Yo preparo la cena.* (I prepare the dinner.)
* **Emphasis on object:** ***La cena**, la preparo yo.* (The dinner, *I* prepare it.)

* **Standard:** *Dije la verdad a Juan.* (I told the truth to Juan.)
* **Emphasis on indirect object:** ***A Juan**, le dije la verdad.* (To Juan, I told the truth.)

## The `Gustar` Structure

Verbs like `gustar` (to be pleasing to) use a different structure that can be confusing. The thing that is liked is the **subject** of the sentence, and the person who likes it is the **indirect object**.

The structure is: **Indirect Object Pronoun + Verb + Subject**

* ***Me gusta el chocolate.*** (Literally: Chocolate is pleasing to me.)
  * Indirect Object Pronoun: *me*
  * Verb: *gusta* (singular, to agree with *el chocolate*)
  * Subject: *el chocolate*

* ***Nos gustan los perros.*** (Literally: Dogs are pleasing to us.)
  * Indirect Object Pronoun: *nos*
  * Verb: *gustan* (plural, to agree with *los perros*)
  * Subject: *los perros*

For emphasis or clarity, you can add a prepositional phrase (`a` + pronoun/name) at the beginning.

* ***A mí** me gusta el chocolate.*
* ***A Juan** le gusta el fútbol.*

## Advanced Negation and Other Sentence Forms

### Double Negatives

Unlike in English, double negatives are grammatically correct and often required in Spanish. Once a sentence is made negative with **no**, any other words that can be negative must also be in their negative form.

Common negative words include:

* **nada** (nothing)
* **nadie** (nobody)
* **nunca** / **jamás** (never)
* **tampoco** (neither)
* **ninguno/a** (none)

There are two main structures for negation:

1. **`no` + verb + negative word**
    * *No veo **nada**.* (I don't see **anything** / I see **nothing**.)
    * *No habla con **nadie**.* (He doesn't speak with **anyone** / He speaks with **nobody**.)
    * *No voy **nunca** al cine.* (I **never** go to the movies.)

2. **Negative word + verb** (In this case, **`no` is not used**)
    * ***Nada** me interesa.* (**Nothing** interests me.)
    * ***Nadie** me conoce.* (**Nobody** knows me.)
    * ***Nunca** voy al cine.* (I **never** go to the movies.)

### Exclamatory Sentences

Exclamatory sentences express strong emotion (surprise, joy, disappointment) and are marked with inverted exclamation points (`¡`) at the beginning and regular ones (`!`) at the end.

They often begin with words like `¡Qué...!`, `¡Cómo...!`, or `¡Cuánto...!`.

* `¡Qué` + noun: *¡Qué lástima!* (What a shame!)
* `¡Qué` + adjective: *¡Qué bonito!* (How beautiful!)
* `¡Cómo` + verb: *¡Cómo llueve!* (It's raining so much!)
