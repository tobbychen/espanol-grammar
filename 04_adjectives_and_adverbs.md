# Part 4: Adjectives and Adverbs

## Adjectives

Adjectives are words that describe nouns. In Spanish, adjectives must agree with the noun in gender and number.

### Agreement of Adjectives

*   If a noun is masculine singular, the adjective must be masculine singular. For example, *el libro **rojo*** (the red book).
*   If a noun is feminine singular, the adjective must be feminine singular. For example, *la casa **roja*** (the red house).
*   If a noun is masculine plural, the adjective must be masculine plural. For example, *los libros **rojos*** (the red books).
*   If a noun is feminine plural, the adjective must be feminine plural. For example, *las casas **rojas*** (the red houses).

### Placement of Adjectives

In Spanish, adjectives usually come **after** the noun.

*   *un coche **rápido*** (a fast car)
*   *una flor **bonita*** (a beautiful flower)

## Adverbs

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They do not change for gender or number.

### Adverbs of Frequency

Adverbs of frequency describe how often an action occurs. Here are some common adverbs of frequency:

*   **siempre** (always)
*   **nunca** (never)
*   **a veces** (sometimes)
*   **todos los días** (every day)

### Examples

*   *Yo **siempre** estudio por la mañana.* (I always study in the morning.)
*   *Ella **nunca** come carne.* (She never eats meat.)
*   ***A veces** voy al cine.* (Sometimes I go to the movies.)
