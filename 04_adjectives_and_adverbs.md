# Part 4: Adjectives and Adverbs

## Adjectives

Adjectives are words that describe nouns or pronouns. In Spanish, adjectives are crucial for adding detail and must always agree with the noun they modify in both gender and number.

### Agreement of Adjectives

Adjectives change their endings to match the gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) of the noun they describe.

* **Adjectives ending in -o:** Change to -a for feminine, -os for masculine plural, -as for feminine plural.
  * *el libro **rojo*** (the red book)
  * *la casa **roja*** (the red house)
  * *los libros **rojos*** (the red books)
  * *las casas **rojas*** (the red houses)

* **Adjectives ending in -e:** Do not change for gender, only for number.
  * *el coche **verde*** (the green car)
  * *la mesa **verde*** (the green table)
  * *los coches **verdes*** (the green cars)
  * *las mesas **verdes*** (the green tables)

* **Adjectives ending in a consonant:** Do not change for gender, only for number (add -es for plural).
  * *el hombre **fácil*** (the easy man)
  * *la tarea **fácil*** (the easy task)
  * *los hombres **fáciles*** (the easy men)
  * *las tareas **fáciles*** (the easy tasks)

### Placement of Adjectives

In Spanish, adjectives typically come **after** the noun they modify. This is the most common and neutral position.

* *un coche **rápido*** (a fast car)
* *una flor **bonita*** (a beautiful flower)

#### Adjectives Before the Noun

Some adjectives can be placed before the noun, often for emphasis, to convey a subjective quality, or when they are commonly associated with the noun. Some even change their meaning depending on their position.

* **Adjectives that change meaning based on position:**
  * *un amigo **viejo*** (an **old** friend, in age) vs. *un **viejo** amigo* (a **long-time** friend)
  * *una mujer **pobre*** (a **poor** woman, lacking money) vs. *una **pobre** mujer* (a **pitiful/unfortunate** woman)
  * *una casa **grande*** (a **large** house) vs. *una **gran** casa* (a **great** house) - *note: `grande` shortens to `gran` before a singular noun.*

* **Common adjectives that often precede the noun:** *bueno/a* (good), *malo/a* (bad), *nuevo/a* (new), *otro/a* (other), *mucho/a* (much/many), *poco/a* (little/few).
  * *un **buen** día* (a good day)
  * *mi **nueva** casa* (my new house)

### Demonstrative Adjectives

These adjectives point out specific nouns and agree in gender and number with the noun.

* **este/esta/estos/estas** (this/these - near the speaker)
  * ***Este** libro es mío.* (This book is mine.)
* **ese/esa/esos/esas** (that/those - near the listener)
  * ***Esa** casa es grande.* (That house is big.)
* **aquel/aquella/aquellos/aquellas** (that/those - far from both)
  * ***Aquellos** árboles son altos.* (Those trees are tall.)

### Possessive Adjectives

These adjectives indicate ownership and agree in number with the noun they modify. The long forms also agree in gender.

* **Short Forms (always before the noun):** *mi, tu, su, nuestro/a, vuestro/a, su*
  * *Es **mi** coche.* (It's **my** car.)
  * *Son **nuestros** amigos.* (They are **our** friends.)

* **Long Forms (always after the noun, for emphasis or clarification):** *mío/a, tuyo/a, suyo/a, nuestro/a, vuestro/a, suyo/a*
  * *Es un coche **mío**.* (It's a car of **mine**.)
  * *Esos libros son **suyos**.* (Those books are **his/hers/theirs/yours**.)

### Comparatives and Superlatives (Adjectives)

#### Comparatives (Comparing two things)

* **más... que** (more... than): *Ella es **más alta que** yo.* (She is **taller than** I.)
* **menos... que** (less... than): *Él es **menos rápido que** su hermano.* (He is **less fast than** his brother.)
* **tan... como** (as... as): *Mi coche es **tan grande como** el tuyo.* (My car is **as big as** yours.)

#### Superlatives (Comparing one thing to a group)

* **el/la/los/las + más/menos + adjective + de** (the most/least... of/in)
  * *Es **el libro más interesante de** la biblioteca.* (It's **the most interesting book in** the library.)
  * *Ella es **la menos ruidosa de** la clase.* (She is **the least noisy in** the class.)

### The Origin of Adjectives

Adjectives in Spanish come from several different sources, including nouns, verbs, and even other adjectives. Recognizing common patterns is a great way to build vocabulary.

#### 1. From Nouns

*   **-oso / -osa** (means "full of"):
    *   `fama` (fame) → `famoso` (famous)
    *   `peligro` (danger) → `peligroso` (dangerous)

*   **-ico / -ica** (forms adjectives of relation):
    *   `historia` (history) → `histórico` (historic)

*   **-al** (forms adjectives of relation):
    *   `nación` (nation) → `nacional` (national)

#### 2. From Verbs

*   **-ado / -ido** (The Past Participle, means "that has been..."):
    *   `cansar` (to tire) → `cansado` (tired)
    *   `divertir` (to amuse) → `divertido` (fun, amusing)

*   **-ante / -ente / -iente** (The Present Participle, means "that does..."):
    *   `impresionar` (to impress) → `impresionante` (impressive)
    *   `interesar` (to interest) → `interesante` (interesting)

*   **-able / -ible** (means "capable of being..."):
    *   `lavar` (to wash) → `lavable` (washable)
    *   `creer` (to believe) → `creíble` (believable)

#### 3. From Other Adjectives (Prefixes)

New adjectives can be formed by adding prefixes (usually for negation).

*   **in- / im- / i-** (means "not"):
    *   `posible` → `imposible`
    *   `legal` → `ilegal`

#### 4. "Base" Adjectives

Some of the most fundamental adjectives don't have a simpler root in modern Spanish.
*   `bueno` (good), `malo` (bad), `grande` (big), `pequeño` (small)

## Adverbs

Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Unlike adjectives, adverbs are **invariable**; they do not change for gender or number.

### Formation of Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed by adding **-mente** (equivalent to -ly in English) to the feminine singular form of an adjective.

* *rápido* (fast) -> *rápidamente* (quickly)
* *lento* (slow) -> *lentamente* (slowly)
* *fácil* (easy) -> *fácilmente* (easily)

### Placement of Adverbs

Adverbs are generally more flexible in their placement than adjectives.

* **Modifying a verb:** Usually placed **after** the verb.
  * *Ella habla **lentamente**.* (She speaks slowly.)
  * *Comimos **mucho**.* (We ate a lot.)

* **Modifying an adjective or another adverb:** Placed **before** the word they modify.
  * *La casa es **muy** grande.* (The house is very big.)
  * *Hablas **demasiado** rápido.* (You speak too quickly.)

* **Adverbs of time and place:** Can often be placed at the beginning or end of a sentence for emphasis.
  * ***Hoy** voy al cine.* (Today I go to the cinema.)
  * *Voy al cine **hoy**.* (I go to the cinema today.)

### Types of Adverbs

* **Manner:** *bien* (well), *mal* (badly), *rápidamente* (quickly), *así* (like this)
* **Place:** *aquí* (here), *allí* (there), *cerca* (near), *lejos* (far), *arriba* (up), *abajo* (down)
* **Time:** *ahora* (now), *ayer* (yesterday), *mañana* (tomorrow), *siempre* (always), *nunca* (never), *a veces* (sometimes)
* **Quantity:** *mucho* (much), *poco* (little), *más* (more), *menos* (less), *muy* (very), *demasiado* (too much)
* **Affirmation:** *sí* (yes), *también* (also), *ciertamente* (certainly)
* **Negation:** *no* (no), *tampoco* (neither), *nunca* (never)
* **Doubt:** *quizás* (perhaps), *tal vez* (maybe)

### Comparatives and Superlatives (Adverbs)

Adverbs also use comparatives and superlatives, similar to adjectives, but they are always invariable.

#### Comparatives

* **más... que** (more... than): *Ella canta **más alto que** yo.* (She sings **louder than** I.)
* **menos... que** (less... than): *Corre **menos rápido que** su hermano.* (He runs **less fast than** his brother.)
* **tan... como** (as... as): *Mi coche va **tan rápido como** el tuyo.* (My car goes **as fast as** yours.)

#### Superlatives

* **el/la/los/las + más/menos + adverb + de** (the most/least... of/in)
  * *Es el que corre **más rápido de** todos.* (He is the one who runs **the fastest of** all.)
  * *Ella es la que habla **menos claramente de** la clase.* (She is the one who speaks **the least clearly in** the class.)
