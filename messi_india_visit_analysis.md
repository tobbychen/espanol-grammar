## Grammatical Analysis

The text uses straightforward grammar to convey information clearly. Here are a few key points:

### 1. Simple Future Tense

The article frequently uses the simple future tense to describe Messi's planned itinerary. This tense is formed by adding endings to the infinitive form of the verb.

*   **Example:** "La superestrella argentina **viajará** a Calcuta..." (The Argentine superstar **will travel** to Calcutta...)
*   **Example:** "Messi también **se reunirá** con famosos..." (Messi **will also meet** with celebrities...)

This is the standard and most direct way to express future actions and plans in Spanish.

### 2. Prepositional Use

*   **`a` for motion:** The preposition `a` is used to indicate movement toward a destination (e.g., `viajará a Calcuta`).
*   **Contraction `al`:** The text shows the contraction of `a + el` into `al`. For example, `aficionados **al** fútbol` (fans **of the** football).
*   **`de` for origin/possession:** The preposition `de` indicates origin or relationship, as in `aficionados... **de** todo el país` (fans... **from** the whole country).

### 3. Verb `Asistir`

*   **Example:** "...**asistirá a** la inauguración de una estatua..."
*   **Note:** This is a common "false friend" for English speakers. In Spanish, `asistir a` means **"to attend,"** not "to assist" or "to help."

### 4. Impersonal Constructions

*   **Example:** "...está **previsto** un partido de exhibición..."
*   **Note:** This is a passive-like construction meaning "an exhibition match **is planned**." It communicates the plan without needing to state who did the planning.
