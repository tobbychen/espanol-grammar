# Part 4: Adjectives and Adverbs (Extended)

## Comparatives

Comparatives are used to compare two things. In Spanish, you use the following structure:

**más/menos + adjective/adverb + que** (more/less ... than)

*   *Juan es **más alto que** María.* (Juan is taller than María.)
*   *Este coche es **menos caro que** el otro.* (This car is less expensive than the other one.)

There are also some irregular comparatives:

*   **bueno/bien** -> **mejor** (better)
*   **malo/mal** -> **peor** (worse)
*   **grande** -> **mayor** (older, greater)
*   **pequeño** -> **menor** (younger, lesser)

## Superlatives

Superlatives are used to say that something is the "most" or the "least." In Spanish, you use the following structure:

**el/la/los/las + más/menos + adjective + de** (the most/least ... of/in)

*   *Juan es **el más alto de** la clase.* (Juan is the tallest in the class.)
*   *Este es **el coche más caro de** todos.* (This is the most expensive car of all.)

## Absolute Superlatives

To say that something is "extremely" or "very" good, you can add the ending **-ísimo/a(s)** to the adjective.

*   *La comida está **riquísima**.* (The food is delicious.)
*   *El hotel es **carísimo**.* (The hotel is very expensive.)
