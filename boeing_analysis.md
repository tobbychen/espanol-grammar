## Summary

An American judge has ruled that Boeing will not go to trial over two plane crashes that killed 346 people. The government requested the case be stopped, a decision the judge criticized, emphasizing the need for passenger safety. The accidents were caused by a malfunctioning part. Boeing had previously reached a settlement but failed to comply with its terms. The company is now allowed to select its own safety inspector. The families of the victims are saddened and angry, demanding safer airplanes and for the company to be truthful.

## Grammar Analysis

The text is written in a simple, direct style, common for news summaries. It primarily uses the present tense to report on events, which is a journalistic convention in Spanish to make the news feel more immediate.

### 1. Present Tense (Presente de Indicativo)

The narrative is built almost entirely in the present tense.

*   **dice** (from **decir** - to say/tell): "Un juez estadounidense **dice**..." (An American judge **says**...)
*   **mueren** (from **morir** - to die): "**Mueren** 346 personas..." (**346 people die**...)
*   **pide** (from **pedir** - to ask for): "El gobierno **pide**..." (The government **asks for**...)
*   **es** (from **ser** - to be): "esto no **es** bueno." (this **is** not good.)
*   **ocurren** (from **ocurrir** - to occur): "Los accidentes **ocurren**..." (The accidents **occur**...)
*   **cumple** (from **cumplir** - to comply/fulfill): "...pero no lo **cumple**." (...but **it does not comply** with it.)
*   **puede** (from **poder** - to be able to): "Ahora la empresa **puede** elegir..." (Now the company **can** choose...)
*   **están** (from **estar** - to be): "Las familias... **están** muy tristes..." (The families... **are** very sad...)

### 2. Subjunctive Mood (Subjuntivo)

The subjunctive mood is used to express desires, doubts, or non-factual statements. It appears here after verbs of volition or request.

*   **detenga** (from **detener** - to stop): "El gobierno pide que se **detenga** el caso." (The government asks that the case **be stopped**.)
    *   The verb `pedir que` (to ask that) triggers the subjunctive.
*   **sean** (from **ser** - to be): "Quieren que los aviones **sean** seguros..." (They want the planes **to be** safe...)
    *   The verb `querer que` (to want that) triggers the subjunctive.
*   **diga** (from **decir** - to say/tell): "...y que la empresa **diga** la verdad." (...and that the company **tell** the truth.)
    *   This follows the same `querer que` structure.
