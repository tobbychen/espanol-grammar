# Part 2: Verbs

## Regular Verbs (Present Tense)

In Spanish, verbs are conjugated to match the subject of the sentence. Regular verbs follow a predictable pattern.

### -ar Verbs

To conjugate a regular -ar verb, remove the -ar ending and add the following endings:

* **-o** (yo): *hablo* (I speak)
* **-as** (tú): *hablas* (you speak)
* **-a** (él/ella/usted): *habla* (he/she/you speak)
* **-amos** (nosotros/as): *hablamos* (we speak)
* **-áis** (vosotros/as): *habláis* (you all speak)
* **-an** (ellos/ellas/ustedes): *hablan* (they/you all speak)

### -er Verbs

To conjugate a regular -er verb, remove the -er ending and add the following endings:

* **-o** (yo): *como* (I eat)
* **-es** (tú): *comes* (you eat)
* **-e** (él/ella/usted): *come* (he/she/you eat)
* **-emos** (nosotros/as): *comemos* (we eat)
* **-éis** (vosotros/as): *coméis* (you all eat)
* **-en** (ellos/ellas/ustedes): *comen* (they/you all eat)

### -ir Verbs

To conjugate a regular -ir verb, remove the -ir ending and add the following endings:

* **-o** (yo): *vivo* (I live)
* **-es** (tú): *vives* (you live)
* **-e** (él/ella/usted): *vive* (he/she/you live)
* **-imos** (nosotros/as): *vivimos* (we live)
* **-ís** (vosotros/as): *vivís* (you all live)
* **-en** (ellos/ellas/ustedes): *viven* (they/you all live)

## Irregular Verbs (Present Tense)

Irregular verbs do not follow the same pattern as regular verbs. Here are a few common irregular verbs:

* **ser** (to be): *soy, eres, es, somos, sois, son*
* **estar** (to be): *estoy, estás, está, estamos, estáis, están*
* **ir** (to go): *voy, vas, va, vamos, vais, van*
* **tener** (to have): *tengo, tienes, tiene, tenemos, tenéis, tienen*

## Ser vs. Estar

*Ser* and *estar* both mean "to be," but they are used in different contexts.

* **Ser** is used to describe permanent or lasting attributes, such as identity, occupation, origin, and time.
* **Estar** is used to describe temporary states, such as location, feelings, and conditions.

### Examples

* *Yo **soy** de España.* (I am from Spain.) - Origin
* *Tú **estás** en la biblioteca.* (You are in the library.) - Location
* *Él **es** alto.* (He is tall.) - Physical attribute
* *Ella **está** cansada.* (She is tired.) - Condition

## Using the Infinitive as a Noun

A unique feature of Spanish grammar is the ability to use the infinitive form of a verb as a noun. When used this way, the infinitive represents the *concept* or *idea* of the action.

It most frequently acts as the subject of a sentence.

**Key Rule:** When an infinitive is used as the subject, it is always treated as a **singular, masculine** noun.

### How to Conjugate the Main Verb

When an infinitive phrase is the subject, the main verb of the sentence is always conjugated in the **third-person singular**. This is because the infinitive subject is treated as a single concept, equivalent to "it" (`él`/`ella`).

* `Viajar por el mundo **cuesta** mucho dinero.` (Traveling the world **costs** a lot of money.)
* `Estudiar **mejora** tus oportunidades.` (Studying **improves** your opportunities.)

### Examples

* **Hacer** deporte **es bueno**. (Doing sports is good.)
  * The subject is the action `Hacer deporte`. The main verb is `es` (third-person singular), and the adjective describing the action is `bueno` (masculine, singular).

* **Fumar** es malo para la salud. (Smoking is bad for your health.)

* **Ver** es creer. (Seeing is believing.)

This is different from when a person is the subject and the verb is conjugated:

* Yo **hago** deporte. (I do sports.)

## Using the Past Participle as a Noun 类似动词被动形态做名词

While the infinitive is used to represent the *action* of a verb as a noun, the **past participle** (`-ado`, `-ido` forms) can also be used as a noun.

However, the meaning is different. A past participle used as a noun refers to the **person or thing that has received the action**.

Since they function as nouns, they have gender and number and must agree with articles and other adjectives.

### Examples

* From **`herir`** (to wound):
  * **`un herido`** / **`una herida`** (a wounded person, male/female)
  * The adjective `herido` (wounded) becomes a noun.

* From **`escribir`** (to write):
  * **`un escrito`** (a written document)
  * This refers to the result of the action of writing.

* From **`prometer`** (to promise):
  * **`lo prometido`** (that which was promised)
  * There is a common saying: *Lo prometido es deuda.* (A promise is a debt.)

* From **`casarse`** (to get married):
  * **`un recién casado`** (a newlywed)

### Contrast with the Infinitive

Remember the key difference in meaning:

* **Infinitive as Noun (The Action):**
  * `Escribir toma tiempo.` (Writing takes time.)

* **Participle as Noun (The Result):**
  * `El escrito era muy largo.` (The written document was very long.)
