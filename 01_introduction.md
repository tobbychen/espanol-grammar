## Nouns

In Spanish, all nouns have a gender (masculine or feminine) and a number (singular or plural).

### Gender of Nouns

The gender of a noun is a fundamental concept in Spanish. While there are general rules, there are also exceptions to be aware of.

#### General Rules

* **Masculine nouns** typically end in **-o**.
  * Examples: *libro* (book), *perro* (dog), *gato* (cat).
* **Feminine nouns** typically end in **-a**.
  * Examples: *casa* (house), *mesa* (table), *silla* (chair).

#### Special Cases and Exceptions

* **Nouns ending in -e or a consonant:** The gender of these nouns can be either masculine or feminine and must be memorized.
  * Masculine examples: *coche* (car), *avión* (airplane), *lápiz* (pencil).
  * Feminine examples: *noche* (night), *leche* (milk), *sal* (salt).
* **Nouns ending in -ión, -dad, -tad, -tud, -umbre:** These are typically feminine.
  * Examples: *canción* (song), *ciudad* (city), *libertad* (liberty), *actitud* (attitude), *costumbre* (custom).
* **Nouns of Greek origin ending in -ma, -pa, -ta:** These are often masculine.
  * Examples: *problema* (problem), *mapa* (map), *planeta* (planet).
* **Common Exceptions:** Some nouns don't follow the general rules.
  * *mano* (hand) is feminine.
  * *día* (day) is masculine.
  * *moto* (motorcycle) is feminine (short for *motocicleta*).
  * *foto* (photograph) is feminine (short for *fotografía*).

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words that replace nouns. In Spanish, pronouns must also agree in gender and number with the noun they are replacing.

### Gender of Pronouns

The gender of a pronoun is determined by the gender of the noun it refers to.

#### Subject Pronouns

Subject pronouns (like "I," "you," "he," "she") are not always explicitly gendered in the same way as nouns, but the choice of other words in the sentence will reflect the gender of the person or thing being referred to.

* **él** (he) - masculine
* **ella** (she) - feminine
* **nosotros** (we) - masculine or mixed group
* **nosotras** (we) - feminine
* **vosotros** (you all, informal) - masculine or mixed group
* **vosotras** (you all, informal) - feminine
* **ellos** (they) - masculine or mixed group
* **ellas** (they) - feminine

For example:

* *Juan es alto. **Él** es mi amigo.* (Juan is tall. **He** is my friend.)
* *María es alta. **Ella** es mi amiga.* (Maria is tall. **She** is my friend.)

#### Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

When using object pronouns (like "it," "him," "her," "them"), it is crucial to remember that the pronoun agrees in gender and number with the **noun it replaces (the object)**, not with the subject of the sentence.

*   **Direct Object Pronouns (lo, la, los, las):** Must match the object in **both gender and number**.
    *   *Ella ve **los coches** (masculine, plural) -> Ella **los** ve.* (She sees them.)
    *   *Yo compro **la falda** (feminine, singular) -> Yo **la** compro.* (I buy it.)

*   **Indirect Object Pronouns (le, les):** Must match the object in **number only**. They do not change for gender.
    *   *Escribo **a mi hermano** (singular) -> **Le** escribo.* (I write to him.)
    *   *Escribo **a mis padres** (plural) -> **Les** escribo.* (I write to them.)

#### The Formal "You": Usted and Ustedes

"Usted" (you, singular, formal) and "ustedes" (you, plural, formal in Spain/all-purpose in Latin America) are crucial for showing respect.

##### "Usted" as a Subject

Primarily, **"usted" is used as a subject pronoun**. It is the person performing the action of the verb. Even though it means "you," it uses the same third-person verb conjugation as "él" (he) and "ella" (she).

* **Usted** es muy amable. (You are very kind.)
* ¿Cómo está **usted**? (How are you?)

##### "Usted" in Object Form

When the formal "you" is the receiver of an action (an object), you use specific object pronouns. The word "usted" itself is not used directly as an object.

* **Direct Object Pronouns**: **lo** (for a man) or **la** (for a woman).
  * *Queremos invitar**lo** a cenar.* (We want to invite **you** to dinner.)
* **Indirect Object Pronoun**: **le**.
  * ***Le** hemos enviado un correo.* (We have sent **you** an email.)

To add clarity or emphasis, the prepositional phrase **"a usted"** is often used.

* *Le entregamos el paquete **a usted**.* (We delivered the package **to you**.)
* *La vi **a usted** en la tienda.* (I saw **you** at the store.)

### Number of Nouns

Making nouns plural in Spanish follows a few key rules.

#### General Rules

* If a noun ends in an unstressed vowel (**a, e, i, o, u**), add **-s**.
  * *libro* -> *libros* (books)
  * *casa* -> *casas* (houses)
  * *coche* -> *coches* (cars)
* If a noun ends in a consonant, add **-es**.
  * *papel* -> *papeles* (papers)
  * *canción* -> *canciones* (songs)

#### Special Cases

* **Nouns ending in -z:** Change the **-z** to a **-c** and add **-es**.
  * *lápiz* -> *lápices* (pencils)
  * *pez* -> *peces* (fish)
* **Nouns ending in an accented vowel + -n or -s:** The written accent is often dropped in the plural form.
  * *avión* -> *aviones* (airplanes)
  * *interés* -> *intereses* (interests)
* **Nouns ending in -s with an unstressed final vowel:** If the singular noun ends in -s and the stress is not on the last syllable, the plural form does not change. The plural is indicated by the article.
  * *el lunes* -> *los lunes* (Mondays)
  * *el paraguas* -> *los paraguas* (umbrellas)
  * *la crisis* -> *las crisis* (crises)

## Articles

Articles are words that come before a noun. In Spanish, articles must agree with the noun in gender and number.

### Definite Articles

Definite articles are used to refer to a specific noun. They are equivalent to "the" in English.

* **el** (masculine singular): *el libro* (the book)
* **la** (feminine singular): *la casa* (the house)
* **los** (masculine plural): *los libros* (the books)
* **las** (feminine plural): *las casas* (the houses)

### Indefinite Articles

Indefinite articles are used to refer to a non-specific noun. They are equivalent to "a," "an," or "some" in English.

* **un** (masculine singular): *un libro* (a book)
* **una** (feminine singular): *una casa* (a house)
* **unos** (masculine plural): *unos libros* (some books)
* **unas** (feminine plural): *unas casas* (some houses)

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use nouns and articles together:

* *El perro come.* (The dog eats.)
* *Una niña juega.* (A girl plays.)
* *Los gatos duermen.* (The cats sleep.)
* *Unas mujeres hablan.* (Some women talk.)
